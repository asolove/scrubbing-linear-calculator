Scrubbing Linear Calculator
===========================

A partial solution to building Bret Victor's scrubbing calculator based on linear constraint programming in Cassowary.

None of the hard work is creditable to me. Instead, go see:

* Bret Victor created the idea for the [scrubbing calculator](http://worrydream.com/ScrubbingCalculator/).
* Alex Russell [updated](https://github.com/slightlyoff/cassowary-js-refactor) Greg Badros' [javascript version](http://badros.blogspot.com/2011/05/cassowary-constraint-solver-in.html) of the [Cassowary toolkit](http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/cassowary/).
